## License  

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Irfan-Ullah-cs/Android-Jetpack-Retrofit/blob/main/LICENSE).  


## Description

This project is an Android application developed as part of an assignment to showcase the use of modern Android development practices. The app utilizes **Retrofit** for REST API integration and **Kotlin Jetpack components** for building a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture.

---

## What is this Project?

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an Android app built with Kotlin. The app dynamically fetches data from a REST API using Retrofit, without offline functionality. Kotlin Jetpack components are employed to ensure lifecycle-aware operations and a responsive UI.

---

## How Does It Work?

The application fetches and displays data in real-time using Retrofit, a modern HTTP client.  
- **Retrofit** handles the API calls.  
- **Kotlin Jetpack components** (e.g., ViewModel, LiveData) manage the UI and application state.  
- No offline storage or local database is implemented.

## Who Will Use This Project?

This project is ideal for:  
- **Students:** Learning about integrating REST APIs and Jetpack components in Android development.  
- **Developers:** Gaining insights into modern Android app architecture.  
- **Open Source Enthusiasts:** Contributing to a Kotlin-based Android project.
